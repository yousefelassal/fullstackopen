  GraphQL query language is basically about selecting fields on objects

  So, for example, in the following query:
  ```js
  {
    hero {
      name
      appearsIn
    }
  }
  ```
  
  result:
  ```js
  {
    "data": {
      "hero": {
        "name": "R2-D2",
        "appearsIn": [
          "NEWHOPE",
          "EMPIRE",
          "JEDI"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  1. We start with a special "root" object
  2. We select the `hero` field on that
  3. For the object returned by `hero`, we select the `name` and `appearsIn` fields
