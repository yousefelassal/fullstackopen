Assuming we are working with Java, we could use Checkstyle or PMD for linting and ensuring code quality,
which could be integrated into the build process to automatically check code during development.

For testing, JUnit is widely used for writing and running unit tests, in addition to Mockito which is used
for mocking dependencies. Another popular tool is Selenium which is used for automated browser testing.

Besided Jenkins and GitHub Actions, other alternative for CI setup include GitLab CI/CD which I would assume
is very similar to GitHub actions, Travis CI, CricleCI, all of which offer similar functionalities for the 
automated pipeline but varies in their pricing and integration options.

Choosing a self-hosted or a cloud based environment is subjective as mentioned in the section but taking in

option to go with the cloud based environment.
